# Space-Shooter

A game I made between 2019 and 2020, when I first started Pygame. Code is not absolutely terrible but a lot of stuff are hardcoded and just not done in a great way. 
It was the first complete game with menus and stuff I've made so.. yeah, a large stepping stone. 
Back then I was incredibly proud of it, now that I look at it, it can be improved in so many aspects, but I'm still happy that I made this. 
Anyway, enjoy the bad code and the glitchy game :)

EDIT: Hey, me from 2025, I would like to add that the code is in fact absolutely terrible, but still happy I made this! :3
